On investing the data
Step 1 - Checking NA values to avoid garbage predictions and improve performance of the model.
Step 2 - Removing the Unnecessary variables in the feature space.
Step 3 - Data Cleaning of available features. 

Step 4 - Exploratory Data Analysis. 

Step 5 - Feature Engineering.
	1.Encoding Categorical Features( Type, Category , Content Rating )
	2.Standard Scaling Numerical Features.
	2.Checking Presence of Correlation among the feature space as it may affect our predictions.
	(No AutoCorrelation Present)
	
Step 6 - Model Building (Linear Regression)
	1.Train Test Splitting
	2.Standar scaler fitting and transform for model.
	3.Fitting Model on Training Set
	4.Predicting on Testing set.
	5.Calculating  error metrices
	RMSE - 50.4%
Step 7 - Model Building (Logistic Regression)
